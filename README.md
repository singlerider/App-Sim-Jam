# App Sim Jam

## Goals

The idea is to empower your ability to create and ideate without the requirement of having a headset available. And if it is available, to get around the requirement of waiting for APK compile times. In this project, you have:

- A properly set-up end-user-ready development environment.
- Unity examples to get you started.

## Setup

- Either clone (requires `git lfs`) or download this project.
- Follow [these instructions](https://developer-docs.magicleap.cloud/docs/guides/unity/getting-started/install-the-tools) to get the ML Hub and Unity Hub installed and set up.
- With the Unity Hub, **the correct version is `2022.2.17f1`**. Double-check that you are installing the correct version.

## Running the Project

When the project is loaded, a window for the Project Setup Tool will automatically pop up. This window will, if it is your first time using Unity, open a file explorer â€” you should select the relevant SDK directory (in this case, `v1.6.0`). After that is selected, click **apply**/**okay**. The Magic Leap Project Setup Tool will still be open. Make sure to click "Apply all" and it will fix your local copy of the project up.
